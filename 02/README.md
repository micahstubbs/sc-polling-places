data from [https://github.com/micahstubbs/VIP-feed-information-project](https://github.com/micahstubbs/VIP-feed-information-project/tree/json)

inspired by [Nadieh Bremer's Scatterplot with Voronoi - ported to d3.v4, and no SVG overlay](http://bl.ocks.org/fil/f49b5cf943a0210212994aa5860ac4a8) from [@recifs](https://twitter.com/recifs)

this example uses the [d3-voronoi-scatterplot](https://github.com/micahstubbs/d3-voronoi-scatterplot) chart component
